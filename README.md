EReceipt
========

Status
-------
The project is still in its initial stage! 

Goal
-------
Nowadays it is very difficult to get easy and complete overview of a family or a person expenses. This project is 
a step forwards solving this problem by offering its users to quickly scan and extract receipts information by using 
their mobile devices. Once the financial data is transmitted in the form of images the server side logic will perform 
a OCR recognition and extract/structure the data in a more usable and manageable form. 

The idea behind the project is to have tree “separate” applications (Mobile application – used to deliver the raw data
,Web application – for management  of the user data, Server – server side logic for business rules and data access)
